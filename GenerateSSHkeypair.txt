GitHub authentication modes:
1. HTTPS (using a personal access token (PAT) genered on GitHub --> Settings --> Developer settings --> Personal access tokens)
2. SSH (using SSH-keys which need to be generted and put on GitHub --> Setting --> SSH and GPG keys)
3. GitHub CLI (the default authentication mode is a web-based browser flow); see gh auth login: https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_auth_login



Connecting to GitHub with SSH
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh
You can connect to GitHub using the Secure Shell Protocol (SSH), which provides a secure channel over an unsecured network.


Generating a new SSH key:
Open Terminal.
Paste the text below, substituting in your GitHub email address.
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
This creates a new SSH key, using the provided email as a label.
> Generating public/private algorithm key pair.
When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter. This accepts the default file location.
> Enter a file in which to save the key (/home/you/.ssh/algorithm): [Press enter]
At the prompt, type a secure passphrase. For more information, see "Working with SSH key passphrases."
> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
> Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent:
Start the ssh-agent in the background.
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
> Agent pid 59566
Depending on your environment, you may need to use a different command. For example, 
you may need to use root access by running sudo -s -H before starting the ssh-agent, 
or you may need to use exec ssh-agent bash or exec ssh-agent zsh to run the ssh-agent.
Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. 
If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, 
replace id_ed25519 in the command with the name of your private key file.
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
Add the SSH key to your account on GitHub. 
For more information, see "Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account.":
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account
Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard.
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Then select and copy the contents of the id_ed25519.pub file
# displayed in the terminal to your clipboard
In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click Settings.
In the user settings sidebar, click SSH and GPG keys.
Click New SSH key or Add SSH key.
In the "Title" field, add a descriptive label for the new key. For example, if you're using a personal Mac, you might call this key "Personal MacBook Air".
Paste your key into the "Key" field.
Click Add SSH key.




Managing remote repositories
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories#switching-remote-urls-from-ssh-to-https


Cloning GitHub repo with SSH URLs:
SSH URLs provide access to a Git repository via SSH, a secure protocol. 
To use these URLs, you must generate an SSH keypair on your computer and add the public key to your account on GitHub.com. 
For more information, see "Connecting to GitHub with SSH.":


When you git clone, git fetch, git pull, or git push to a remote repository using SSH URLs, 
you'll be prompted for a password and must provide your SSH key passphrase. 
For more information, see "Working with SSH key passphrases."
